---++ Introduction

The !WikiWorkbench standardizes writing, deploying and using wiki applications
on Foswiki. It builds on the core concepts of standard Foswiki and establishes
a unified terminology to leverage concepts and key benefits known from
conventional programming towards wiki applications. These are:

   * separation of programming code from net data: clearly distinguish the roles of wiki application programmers and wiki authors 
   * reusability: bundle functions into libraries to be used in multiple places
   * abstraction: establish a multi-level architecture of wiki applications, one built upon the other 
   * standardize model, view and control: share common concepts defining !DataForms, view and edit templates
   * typed content: establish a hierarchy of !TopicTypes to let topics participate in specific wiki applications
   * documentation: auto-generate complete documentation for a wiki application ready to be printed out

While these concepts are nothing new for a normal programmer, they do have a
clear equivalent using Foswiki as an application framework. Wiki applications
still are written in TML using your browser on your foswiki site. However, all
bits are managed in a clean way to guarantee that you will still find them
years later. People trained to write wiki applications the !WikiWorkbench way
will immediately know where to look and fix applications written by others, as
they all share the same concepts.  So by establishing a clear teminology and
best practice, you will be able to maintain even large wiki apps consisting of
hundrets of different components working
together long term. 

!WikiWorkbench has been developed over the last 5 years working together with a
series of companies in need of large scale wiki applications, custom tailored to their
business needs, covering fields like

   * human resource management 
   * skills management
   * project management
   * tour planning
   * book reviewing
   * public relations management
   * employee training
   * knowledge management
   * vacation planning
   * corporate blogging
   * enterprise search applications 

---++ Getting started

When installing the !WikiWorkbench, you will get two new webs: 

   * Applications: the core of the !WikiWorkbench
   * _WikiApplicationTemplate: an application template to bootstrap a new wiki app

The [[Applications.WebHome][Applications web]] is the starting point accessing and creating
all wiki applications. There's a button to create a new wiki application.

   1 Click on the button "New !WikiApplication".
   1 Enter the name of your new wiki application, e.g. !MyCompanyApp (this must be a valid web name for foswiki)
   1 Enter a short description what this application is about.
   1 Click "Submit".

This will create a new subweb under Applications web (e.g. !Applications.MyCompanyApp). 

All !WikiWorkbench applications are located under the Applications web. Any
code part of your application will be contained in this newly created subweb.

In this sense a "wiki application" is the sum of all components stored in the
Applications subweb (Applications.MyCompanyApp).  You will be able to write and
maintain the wiki application by going to this web.

A wiki application is made up of different components that are used when deploying it to one or more 
target webs...
